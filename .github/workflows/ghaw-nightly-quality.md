2. **Security Signal**
   - Any security scan failures?
   - Dependabot alerts opened or dismissed?

3. **PR Health**
   - PRs opened, merged, closed today
   - Any PRs sitting > 3 days without review
   - PRs missing linked issues
   - PRs modifying shared-contracts or API schemas

4. **Issue Health**
   - New issues opened today
   - Issues without labels
   - Open `incident` issues
   - Stale open issues (no activity > 7 days)

5. **Recommended next 3 actions** for maintainers — specific and actionable.
